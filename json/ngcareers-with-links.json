This legal document came into force on 15 February 2012 with about 10 countries signing and ratifying the document. Another 28 countries signed but have not ratified while 18 countries still have a neutral position on it. The ACDEG has since 2012 been ratified by 45 countries.<br><br>The instrument aims at reinforcing the commitment of the AU Member States towards the promotion and consolidation of democratic governance and human rights on the continent. The formulation of this charter was stimulated by different decisions, declarations, resolutions and normative instruments of AU. These instruments include the 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; the 1999 Algiers Decision on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa; the 2000 Lom\u00e9 Declaration on the Framework for an AU Response to Unconstitutional Changes of Government; the 2002 AU Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa; and the 2002 Constitutive Act of the AU.<br><br>The charter seeks to Promote adherence, by each State Party, to the universal values and principles of democracy and respect for human rights; Promote and enhance adherence to the principle of the rule of law premised upon the respect for, and the supremacy of the constitution and constitutional order in the political arrangements of the State Parties. It also seeks to Promote the holding of regular free and fair elections to institutionalise legitimate authority of representative government as well as democratic change of governments; Prohibit, reject and condemn unconstitutional change of government in any member state as a serious threat to stability, peace, security and development amidst other objectives. The charter further empowers the African Union Commission (AUC) through the Democracy and Electoral Assistance Unit and the Democracy and Electoral Assistance Fund to offer technical assistance to AU Member States towards the strengthening and improvement of their electoral institutions and processes.<br><br>The implementation of ACDEG is envisaged to take place at national, regional and continental levels, leveraging normative instruments, policies and structures at those levels as stipulated under Article 44 of ACDEG. Since the adoption of the charter in 2012, different countries have made tremendous effort in the entrenchment of democracy and good governance in Africa. But of the 45 African countries signatory to ACDEG, only the Republic of Togo has since submitted its initial State Report on the implementation of the principles and commitments to the Charter.

This legal document came into force on 15 February 2012 with about 10 countries signing and ratifying the document. Another 28 countries signed but have not ratified while 18 countries still have a neutral position on it. The ACDEG has since 2012 been ratified by 45 countries.<br><br>The instrument aims at reinforcing the commitment of the AU Member States towards the promotion and consolidation of democratic governance and human rights on the continent. The formulation of this charter was stimulated by different decisions, declarations, resolutions and normative instruments of AU. These instruments include the 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; the 1999 Algiers Decision on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa; the 2000 Lom\u00e9 Declaration on the Framework for an AU Response to Unconstitutional Changes of Government; the 2002 AU Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa; and the 2002 Constitutive Act of the AU.<br><br>The charter seeks to Promote adherence, by each State Party, to the universal values and principles of democracy and respect for human rights; Promote and enhance adherence to the principle of the rule of law premised upon the respect for, and the supremacy of the constitution and constitutional order in the political arrangements of the State Parties. It also seeks to Promote the holding of regular free and fair elections to institutionalise legitimate authority of representative government as well as democratic change of governments; Prohibit, reject and condemn unconstitutional change of government in any member state as a serious threat to stability, peace, security and development amidst other objectives. The charter further empowers the African Union Commission (AUC) through the Democracy and Electoral Assistance Unit and the Democracy and Electoral Assistance Fund to offer technical assistance to AU Member States towards the strengthening and improvement of their electoral institutions and processes.<br><br>The implementation of ACDEG is envisaged to take place at national, regional and continental levels, leveraging normative instruments, policies and structures at those levels as stipulated under Article 44 of ACDEG.

Another 28 countries signed but have not ratified while 18 countries still have a neutral position on it. The ACDEG has since 2012 been ratified by 45 countries.\u00a0<br><br>The instrument aims at reinforcing the commitment of the AU Member States towards the promotion and consolidation of democratic governance and human rights on the continent. The formulation of this charter was stimulated by different decisions, declarations, resolutions and normative instruments of AU. These instruments include the 1981 African Charter on Human and Peoples\u2019 Rights; the 1999 Algiers Decision on Unconstitutional Changes of Government in Africa; the 2000 Lom\u00e9 Declaration on the Framework for an AU Response to Unconstitutional Changes of Government; the 2002 AU Declaration on the Principles Governing Democratic Elections in Africa; and the 2002 Constitutive Act of the AU.\u00a0<br><br>The charter seeks to Promote adherence, by each State Party, to the universal values and principles of democracy and respect for human rights; Promote and enhance adherence to the principle of the rule of law premised upon the respect for, and the supremacy of the constitution and constitutional order in the political arrangements of the State Parties. It also seeks to Promote the holding of regular free and fair elections to institutionalise legitimate authority of representative government as well as democratic change of governments; Prohibit, reject and condemn unconstitutional change of government in any member state as a serious threat to stability, peace, security and development amidst other objectives.

First established in the UK in 1919, separate national organizations have been set up in more than twenty-eight countries, sharing the aim of improving the lives of children through education, health care and economic opportunities, as well as emergency aid in cases of natural disasters, war and conflict.<br><br>In Nigeria, Save the Children has been working since 2001. The early focus was on getting children actively involved in shaping the decisions that affect their lives. Today, Save the Children is working in seven federal states - Zamfara, Yobe, Jigawa, Katsina, Kano, Bauchi and Kaduna - focusing on providing basic healthcare and protecting children.</p>", "<p><strong>Project Overview</strong><br>Nigeria has an estimated population of 182 million people, of which over 22.5% are adolescents (aged 10-19). The REACH project specifically targets states with some of the worst indicators for adolescents, especially girls, and will focus on rural and hard to reach communities. Across Nigeria, 11.6% of girls are married by age 15 and 49% are married by 18. Wide regional disparities exist within the country, with the Northern region demonstrating the worst outcomes for health, nutrition, education, poverty, and early marriage. Zamfara state has the lowest median age of marriage for girls in the country at 14.5 years, with Gombe at 16 years and Katsina at 15 years (DHS, 2013). On average, men are nine years older than women at the age of their first marriage, however focus group discussions in target states identified married adolescent boys (ages 15-19) who confirmed the need for more information on antenatal care (ANC), immunization and family planning. In addition, research shows that ages of first sexual encounter for adolescent girls are often up to two years earlier in rural areas than in urban areas (National HIV &amp; AIDS and RH Survey, 2012).
